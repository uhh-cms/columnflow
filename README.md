⚠️ The columnflow project was moved to [github.com/columnflow/columnflow](https://github.com/columnflow/columnflow).

In case you had columnflow previously setup as a submodule in your project, run

```shell
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:columnflow/columnflow.git
```

to change the URL of the remote.
